1. In this app, users would select major parts of the computer to build their own computer.
2. It uses API to retrieve data in an asynchronous process. Depending on each component chosen by the user, it will calculate the specs of the computer and compare whether it is better for work or gaming.

## What I learned

* How to use API to get data by asynchronous processing.
* How to use JSON, Promise Object, and Lambda function.
* How to deal with complex state logic (managed with useContext, useReducer).


### Built With
